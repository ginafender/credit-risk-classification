## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the effectiveness of machine learning models to determine credit risk. The dataset was from past lending activity, and was used to predict high risk and low risk loan applications. 

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    * Accuracy:
    * Precision:
    * Recall:



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    * Accuracy:
    * Precision:
    * Recall:


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
